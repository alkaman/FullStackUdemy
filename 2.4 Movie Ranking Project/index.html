    <h1>The Best Movies According to Alan</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Twelve Monkeys</h3>
    <p>Love the plot twists and how all scenes are conected in the movie.</p>
    <h3>Star Wars</h3>
    <p>It's really hard to think of one alone, for me is a must see saga if you are a sci-fy fan, at least episode 1 to 6. Lot's of character development, great soundtracks and lot's of epic moments and battles.</p>
    <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
    <p>Full of epic scenarios, battles, characters, music.</p>
